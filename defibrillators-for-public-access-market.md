<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Defibrillators for Public Access Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automated</li><li>Fully automated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Defibrillators for public access are crucial for responding to cardiac emergencies. Semi-automated defibrillators require minimal operator intervention; they analyze heart rhythm and prompt users to deliver a shock if necessary, providing audio and visual instructions. Conversely, fully automated defibrillators perform all functions independently, automatically delivering shocks without user action. Both types are designed for layperson use, promoting quick response in public settings like airports and schools, ultimately increasing the chances of survival in cardiac arrest situations.</p></p>
